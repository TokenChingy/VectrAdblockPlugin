# Vectr Adblock Plugin

_Version_: 1.0.0
_License_: [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/).

## Chrome Extension

### Introduction

This chrome extension will remove the advertisements when using the online Vectr application.

### Installation

#### Users on Chrome OS, MacOS, and Linux

1.  Visit `chrome://extensions` or via omnibox or menu -> Tools -> Extensions.
2.  Enable Developer mode by ticking/toggling the checkbox in the upper-right corner.
3.  Click on the "Load unpacked extension..." button.
4.  Select the directory containing the _Vectr Adblock Plugin_.

#### Users on Windows

Windows users can also load an unpacked extension, but they will always see an information bubble with "Disable developer mode extensions" when they start Chrome or open a new incognito window, which is really annoying. The only way for Windows users to use unpacked extensions without such dialogs is to switch to Chrome on the developer channel, by installing [Chrome Developer Channel](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/index.html?extra=devchannel#eula).
